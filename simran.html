<font color="white">My name is <b>CH Simran Saba</b> I've completed my schooling at ST.PHILOMENA'S SCHOOL.My PUC at BPSC PU COLLEGE.
Talking about my results I've secured 83% in the science stream.My dream was to become a software engineer through 
engineering field only but my parents were against  it so I couldn't pursue it.
I've done each and every thing to convince them but somehow it didn't workout! 
I've joined the BCA program at KISHKINDA UNIVERSITY with a lots of hopes and tears because I truly 
believe that my incomplete dreams will be fulfilled through this way.</font color>
